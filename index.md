## Projects

### Motion Capture and Retargeting of Fish by Monocular Camera 
(2016/05 – 2017/05)
![FishImg](img/Fish.png)
Motion capture and retargeting of fish generally have difficulties in marker attachment and feature description of the soft body. We employ a contour-based feature extraction to extract the motion pattern of a fish from video sequences, and propose a two-level motion retargeting scheme to retarget the recorded motion to a new fish model, regardless of its body and fin proportions. As a result, we can drive a hand-drawn fish or fish-like characters to swim with the same motion style as the real one in the video.
